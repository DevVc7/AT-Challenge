# The Problem

We are building a Referral Tracking System for our real estate company. When an agent is hired, they have the ability to refer other agents. These referred agents can, in turn, refer more agents, creating a referral chain.

Your task is to design and implement a solution to model and track this chain of referrals. The system should allow us to create and manage a referral tree of agents in a hierarchical structure.

    - The system must require the user to log in before accessing the app.
    - The user should enter a username and password for authentication.
    - When the user logs in, the "status" of the user should be update to "active".
    
2. Display and Manage Referrals:

    - The referral tree should be visualized in a grid or table format, where each agent and their direct referrals are shown at the appropriate levels.
    - The tree should be easily navigable to allow users to quickly see the hierarchy of referrals.

3. Add New Agents:

    - The system must allow new agents to be added at any level of the tree.
    - A new agent can either be added as a direct referral of an existing agent, or inserted into any existing position within the tree.

# Additional Considerations:

The referral chain may be deep, so performance and scalability are critical, especially in terms of how the system handles large numbers of agents and hierarchy.
The UI should be intuitive and responsive, ensuring easy interaction with the referral tree.
Ensure the app is modular and well-structured.
